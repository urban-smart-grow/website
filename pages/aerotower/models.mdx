# Models

Below are previews of the 3d models for printing. [You may download the files directly from Github.](https://github.com/urban-smart-grow/AeroTower/tree/main/exports)
For printing, PETG is recommended. It is easy to print and does not deform under sun exposure.
All models can be printend without supports and with your normal print settings.
The only special part is the [water tank](#tower-tank), which needs to be printed watertight. To configure your slicer to do that, [you can inform yourself here](https://help.prusa3d.com/article/watertight-prints_112324).

## Body

This is the main module of the tower. You can print this model multiple times and stack them together.

## Plant Cup

These cups are designed to contain the plants from seed to harvest.
Five cups can be mounted into one tower module.
