# AeroTower

When searching for an inexpensive aeroponics system, which was also scalable and modifiable, not many options were found. That is how this project came to life.

The AeroTower is designed (WIP) to serve as an easy entry for people into the world of aeroponics. You can start at **low cost**, **modify** everything as you build it and finally **scale** the system up, if you want to.

In its final form, the AeroTower should be completly **open source** (model, electronics, firmware), **self-sufficient** in terms of energy through a solar panel and connected like an IoT device.

## Vertical Farming

The AeroTower is designed to make this concept more tangible while also allowing for scaling the system up to a complete farm, which can be operated indoor or outdoor.

## The Model

The model itself is inspired by archipelagourbanfarms' [Modular Hydroponic System](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2403922) but designed from the ground up. A 3d printable water tank is added, the parts can be screwed together and everything is printable on machines as small as the [Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/). You can view the source files [here](https://github.com/mfillmer/3d-modelling/tree/master/smart_grow/aero_tower) or edit them. For editing, it is recommended to first take a look at [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython), which is used here.

## Electronics

To build the electronics of the AeroTower, [please have a look here](aerotower/electronics).
For the moment, the circuitry needs to powered by an external power source. To become fully self sufficient, power supply by battery and solar is planned.

## Grow Media

## Lighting

By intention, lighting is not part of the AeroTower. The tower is designed to supply plants with water and nutrients while being powered by light itself.

If you plan to use the tower indoors with artificial lighting, you can follow [this link](https://lightsciencetech.com/what-are-par-ppf-and-ppfd-and-why-should-you-care/) to learn about metrics for grow lights.

To find the right light system for you, a good start could be to search for lights using the LM301B, [an energy efficient LED from Samsung](https://hackaday.com/2022/10/31/a-single-watt-hydroponic-lighting-system/) which could also be bought [here](https://www.led-tech.de/de/21x-Samsung-LM301B-Streifenplatine-3500k).
