# Folder for text snippets

This is a folder for small, reusable chunks of text inside mdx files.

The idea is similar to that of a [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten), where small notes are taken and linked together, which enables a faster composition of texts.

From the Wikipedia article:

> A Zettelkasten (German: "slip box", plural Zettelk√§sten) or card file consists of small items of information stored on paper slips or cards that may be linked to each other through subject headings or other metadata such as numbers and tags. It has often been used as a system of note-taking and personal knowledge management for research, study, and writing.
