# AeroTower

When searching for an inexpensive aeroponics system, which was also scalable and modifiable, not many options were found. That is how this project came to life.

The AeroTower is designed (WIP) to serve as an easy entry for people into the world of aeroponics. You can start at **low cost**, **modify** everything as you build it and finally **scale** the system up, if you want to.

In its final form, the AeroTower should be completly **open source** (model, electronics, firmware), **self-sufficient** in terms of energy through a solar panel and connected like an IoT device.

## The Model

The model itself is inspired by archipelagourbanfarms' [Modular Hydroponic System](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2403922) but designed from the ground up. A 3d printable water tank is added, the parts can be screwed together and everything is printable on machines as small as the [Prusa Mini](https://www.prusa3d.com/category/original-prusa-mini/). You can view the source files [here](https://github.com/mfillmer/3d-modelling/tree/master/smart_grow/aero_tower) or edit them. For editing, it is recommended to first take a look at [SolidPython](https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython), which is used here.
