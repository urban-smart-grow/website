Vertical Farming is a new approach to growing food safely and consistently.
Instead of using flat land to produce food, multiple layers can be stacked on top of each other, maximizing the overall grow aera. Moreover, the production can be moved into cities and inside buildings, much closer to where the food is consumed eventually and independent of weather and other environmental factors.
To grow crops indoors efficiently, techniques like hydro- or aeroponics are often used.

The [original vision](https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2011/10/13/vertical-farms-from-vision-to-reality/) of a vertical farm is that of a skyscraper, where different crops can be harvested on multiple stories, throughout the year.
